```

## Deployment Options

### 1. ðŸš€ Dynamo Cloud Platform [PREFERRED]

The Dynamo Cloud Platform provides a managed deployment experience with:
- Automated infrastructure management
- Built-in monitoring and metrics
- Simplified deployment process via `dynamo deploy` CLI commands
- Production-ready configurations
- Managed NATS and etcd dependencies

For detailed instructions, see:
- [Dynamo Cloud Platform Guide](../docs/guides/dynamo_deploy/dynamo_cloud.md)
- [Operator Deployment Guide](../docs/guides/dynamo_deploy/operator_deployment.md)

### 2. Manual Deployment with Helm Charts

For users who need more control over their deployments:
- Full control over deployment parameters
- Manual management of infrastructure
- Customizable monitoring setup
- Flexible configuration options
- Manual management of NATS and etcd dependencies

Documentation:
- [Manual Helm Deployment Guide](../docs/guides/dynamo_deploy/manual_helm_deployment.md)
- [Minikube Setup Guide](../docs/guides/dynamo_deploy/minikube.md)

## Choosing the Right Deployment Method

- **Dynamo Cloud Platform**: Best for most users, provides managed deployment with built-in monitoring
  - See [Dynamo Cloud Platform Guide](../docs/guides/dynamo_deploy/dynamo_cloud.md)
  - Recommended for production deployments
  - Simplifies dependency management
  - Provides infrastructure for user management

- **Manual Helm Deployment**: For users who need full control over their deployment
  - See [Manual Helm Deployment Guide](../docs/guides/dynamo_deploy/manual_helm_deployment.md)
  - Suitable for custom deployments
  - Requires manual management of dependencies
  - Provides maximum flexibility for users

## Example Deployments

To help you get started, we provide several example deployments:

### Hello World Example
A basic example to learn Dynamo deployment: [Hello World Example](../examples/hello_world/README.md#deploying-to-and-running-the-example-in-kubernetes)
- Shows how to deploy a simple three-service pipeline that processes text
- Provides step-by-step instructions for building your service and testing with port forwarding
- Includes sample output showing the text flow between services

### LLM Examples
Example for deploying LLM services: [LLM Example](../examples/llm/README.md#deploy-to-kubernetes)
- Demonstrates deploying and making inference requests against LLM models
- Includes examples for both aggregated and disaggregated serving
- Provides detailed deployment steps and testing instructions
